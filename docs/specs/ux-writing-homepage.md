# **Review your interface copy like a UX writer would**

## **Great UX writing makes products feel effortless**

Every word on a button, tooltip, or error message shapes how users move through your product.

Chordio checks your designs against proven UX writing principles, helping you spot unclear phrasing, tone mismatches, and moments that break user flow.

| **Principle** | **What It Means** | **Real-World Pitfall** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Clarity** | Write like you speak. Users shouldn’t need to think twice. | “Re-compute settings” leaves users unsure what happens next. |
| **Conciseness** | Keep it short. Every word should earn its place. | Long tooltips or help text that explain more than they need to. |
| **Consistency** | Use the same terms and tone across screens. | “Delete” on one screen, “Remove” on another. Users hesitate. |
| **Empathy** | Anticipate confusion. Offer guidance, not blame. | “You entered the wrong code.” feels accusatory. “That code didn’t work. Try again.” feels supportive. |
| **Action Orientation** | Help users know what to do next. | Buttons like “Proceed” are vague. “Save and continue” is clear. |
| **Error Recovery** | Don’t just describe the problem. Help users fix it. | “Something went wrong” offers no next step. |
| **Accessibility** | Use language that everyone can understand. | Overly complex instructions or insider jargon exclude users. |

> Chordio checks every selected frame or web page against these principles. Each review shows which rules pass, which fail, and what could be improved. You see the results right in context, so you can make fast, confident edits.

## **Why teams struggle with UX writing**

If your interface copy feels inconsistent or confusing, it’s often not because the writers aren’t good. It’s because the process isn’t built to support good writing.

Here are the common challenges teams face — and how Chordio helps solve them.

### **Copy written too late**

Microcopy is often added after design decisions are made.

**Chordio** brings writing into the design process, so you can catch and fix wording issues early.

### **No shared guardrails**

Tone and terminology drift across products and features.

**Chordio** applies consistent rules for language, tone, and voice across your product.

### **Context gets lost**

Copy is reviewed in docs or spreadsheets, not inside the design.

**Chordio** reviews words where they appear — inside Figma frames or live web pages.

### **Scaling content governance**

As teams grow, it’s hard to maintain consistency and accessibility across every message.

**Chordio** automates checks for clarity, tone, and inclusivity so nothing slips through.
